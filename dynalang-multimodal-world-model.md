### Overview
Dynalang introduces a novel approach to multimodal A2A systems by unifying language understanding with future prediction through world modeling. Unlike previous methods that struggle with diverse language inputs, Dynalang successfully integrates natural language, visual understanding, and action generation through a predictive learning framework.

### Technical Highlights
- Multimodal world model architecture predicting future text and image representations
- Self-supervised learning objective combining language understanding with future prediction
- Zero-shot generalization across different environments and tasks
- Ability to pretrain on text-only data with successful transfer to multimodal scenarios
- Implementation of imagined model rollouts for action planning

### Why It Matters for A2A
This work demonstrates a practical framework for building AI systems that can effectively communicate across language and vision modalities while maintaining actionable understanding. The ability to pretrain on text data and transfer to multimodal scenarios opens new possibilities for scalable A2A systems.

### Code Implementation
The repository provides:
- Full implementation of Dynalang architecture
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Pretrained model weights
- Environment configurations for reproducibility
